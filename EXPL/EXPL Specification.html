    <article id="nav-data-types" class="detail">
      <h2>Supported data types</h2>

      <h3>Primitive data types</h3>
        <p><b>Integer</b> :  An integer type variable is declared using the keyword <b>int</b>.  <i>Example</i> : </p>
        <pre>            int a, b, c;  /* Declares variables a, b, c of type integer */
        </pre>

        <p><b>String</b> :  A string is a sequence of characters.  A string type variable is declared using the keyword <b>str</b>.   <i>Example</i> : </p>
        <pre>            str mystring;   /*  Declares a variable mystring of type string.  */
        </pre>


        <p><b>Boolean</b> :  ExpL does not permit boolean variables. But logical expressions like (a &lt; b) or (a==b) &amp; (a&lt;5) are supported and are considered to be of type boolean.  </p>

      <h3>Composite data types</h3>
        <p><b>Arrays</b></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Arrays can be of <b>integer</b> or <b>string</b> type only.  Only single-dimensional arrays are allowed.   The semantics is similar to that of C programming language.  Arrays are  allocated statically.  </p>
        <p><i>Example</i> :</p>
        <pre>          int a[10];            /* array a indexed a[0],a[1],..a[9], can store 10 integers*/
          str stringlist[10];   /* stringlist is an array of 10 strings */
        </pre>
        <p><b>User-defined types</b></p> <p style="text-indent: 3em;">ExpL allows user defined data types. The (member) <b>fields</b> of a user defined type may be of type a) integer, b) string,  c) a previously defined user defined type or d) the type that is currently being defined. Arrays of user defined types are <b>not</b> allowed.  </p>
        <p><i>Note</i> : ExpL specifies that the <b>store</b>  for variables of user defined types shall be <b>dynamically allocated</b>. Hence the programmer has to call the library function alloc() to allocate store for variables of user defined types before use.  <b> User defined types take default value NULL unless allocated or assigned otherwise.</b>  Store allocated for a variable of a user defined type is de-allocated using the free() library function.</p>
        <p><i>Example</i> : A user defined type, mytype is defined as:</p>
        <pre>          mytype
          {
            int a;
            str b;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>a variable of type mytype is declared as:</p>
        <pre>          mytype var;
        </pre>
        <p>Storage for the variable is allocated as:</p>
        <pre>          var=alloc(mytype);   /* Note:  Access without allocation can lead to run time errors */
        </pre>
        <p>Its fields may be accessed as:</p>
        <pre>          var.a=10;     /*  the “.” symbol is used to access member fields */
          var.b="hello";
        </pre>
        <p>The memory allocated may be freed as:</p>
        <pre>          retval = free(var);
        </pre>
        <p><i>Note</i> :  The ExpL compiler may internally represent var like a pointer variable. The library function alloc may be designed so as to allocate memory and return pointer to allocated memory. (Library functions are explained in detail later on.) The returned pointer is stored in var.   </p>

      <h2>Statements and Expressions</h2>

      <p>Before taking up statements, we should look at the different kinds of <b>constants</b> and <b>expressions</b> in the language.  ExpL has two kinds of expressions,  a) <b>Arithmetic</b> expressions and b) <b>Logical</b> expressions.    </p>

      <h3>Constants</h3>
        <p>Any numerical value (Example: 234) is an <i>integer constant</i>.  A quoted string (Example: “hello”) is a <i>string constant</i>. </p>

      <h3>Arithmetic Expressions</h3>
        <p>Any integer constant/variable is a valid arithmetic expression, provided the scope rules  are not violated.  ExpL treats a function returning integer as an expression and the value of a function is its return value.</p>
        <p>ExpL provides five <b>arithmetic operators</b>, viz., +, -, *, / (Integer Division) and % (Modulo operator) through which arithmetic expressions may be combined. Expression syntax and semantics are similar to standard practice in programming languages and normal rules of precedence, associativity and paranthesization hold. eXpL is strongly typed and <b>any type mismatch or scope violation must be reported at compile time</b>.</p>
        <p><i>Example</i> :  5, a[a[5+x]]+x , (f2() + b[x] + 5) etc. are arithmetic expressions, provided type and scope rules are not violated.  </p>

      <h3>Logical Expressions</h3>
          <p>Logical expressions may be formed by combining arithmetic expressions using <b>relational operators</b>. The relational operators supported by eXpL are &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, and !=. Again <b>standard syntax and semantics conventions apply</b>. Logical expressions may be combined using logical operators <b>and</b>, <b>or</b> and <b>not</b>.  Note that the relational operators except == and != can compare only two arithmetic expressions and not two logical expressions.  </p>
          <p><i>Variables of string type or user defined types can only be checked for equality/inequality using the ==/!= operator. </i></p>
          <p><i>Example</i> :((x==y)==a[3]) is <b>not valid</b> eXpL expression because (x==y) is a logical expression, while a[3] must be a variable of type integer/string.   The "==" operator can be applied only between expressions of the same type.  </p>
          <p>(“hello”==a) is a valid logical expression provided, a is a variable of string type.  (p==q) is a valid logical expression provided p and q are variables of the same type.  </p>

      <h3>Assignment Statement</h3>
          <p>The general syntax of the assignment statement is :</p>
          <pre>            Lvalue = Rvalue;
          </pre>
          <p>The possible Lvalues are variables or an indexed array variables.  If the Lvalue has type integer, the Rvalue can be any arithmetic expression.  If the Lvalue has type string, the Rvalue can be a string constant or a variable of type string.   If the Lvalue is a user defined variable, the Rvalue must be a user defined variable.</p>
          <p><i>Example</i> : q[3]= “hello” ; t= “world” ; are both valid assignments to string variables provided q is declared as an array of type string and t is declared as a variable of type string.   x=y; is valid if x and y are of the same type and scope rules are not violated.   </p>
          <p>In an assignment x=y where x  and  y are of a primitive type (integer or string), the value inside the location indicated by y is copied into the location indicated by x. On the other hand, if x and y are of a user defined type, the assignment only makes both x and y refer to the same memory object. This is because a variable of a user defined type stores a reference to its store allocated using alloc().   </p>                            <h3>Conditional  Statement</h3>
          <p>The eXpL conditional statement has the following syntax:</p>
          <pre>          if &lt; Logical Expression &gt; then
            Statements
          else
            Statements
          endif;
          </pre>
          <p>The <b>else</b> part is optional. The statements inside an <b>if</b>-block may be conditional, iterative, assignment, input/output, break or continue statements, but <b>not</b> the return statement.</p>

      <h3>Iterative Statement</h3>
          <p>The eXpL iterative statement has the following syntax:</p>
          <pre>          while &lt; Logical Expression &gt; do
            Statements
          endwhile;
          </pre>
          <p>Standard conventions apply in this case too. The statements inside a <b>while</b>-block may be conditional, iterative, assignment, input/output, break or continue statements, but <b>not</b> the return statement.</p>

      <h3>Return Statement</h3>
        <p>The body of each function (including main) should have <b>exactly one</b> return statement and it should be the <b>last statement</b> in the body. The syntax is:</p>
        <pre>        return &lt; Expression &gt; ;               /* if the return type of the function is integer*/
        return &lt; string constant/variable &gt; ; /* If the return type is string */
        return &lt; variable &gt;;                  /* If the return type of the function is a user defined type*/
        </pre>
        <p>If the return type of the function does not match the type of the expression/variable returned,  a compilation error should occur.  The <b>return type of main is integer</b> by specification</p>

      <h3>Break and Continue Statements</h3>
        <p>A <b>break;</b> statement inside a conditional/iterative block tranfers control to the end of the block.  A <b>continue;</b> inside a conditional/iterative block transfers control to the beginning of the block.    These statements do nothing if not inside any conditional/iterative statement.  </p>
        <p>The next section briefly discusses the library functions for dynamic memory allocation.</p>

    </article>

    <article class="detail" id="nav-dynamic-memory-allocation">
      <h2>Dynamic memory allocation</h2>

      <p>The library functions <b>alloc()</b> and <b>free()</b> are used as follows:  </p>
      <pre>        t = alloc(); /* Allocates HBSIZE contiguous locations in the heap –
        t must be a user defined variable */
        t = free(t);  /* Free the allocated block – t must be a user defined variable */
      </pre>
      <p>A call to alloc() allocates HBSIZE contiguous memory locations in the heap memory (memory reserved for dynamic memory allocation) and returns the address of the starting location. In this version of ExpL, HBSIZE is set to 8 words. This address may be stored in a variable of user defined type .  A call to free() deallocates HBSIZE contiguous memory locations in the heap memory that is referenced by user defined type variable t. The function free()  returns NULL on successful deallocation.  Otherwise, the value of t is unchanged by call to free().    All unallocated user defined variables are set to predefined constant  NULL.</p>

    </article>

    <article class="detail" id="nav-file-spec">
    <h2>Files and Input/Output</h2>

    <p>ExpL specifies a set interfaces (functions) file operations and standard input/output. The implementation of these interfaces may involve translation into the system calls provided by the host operating system. The purpose of these functions is to ensure that ExpL programs using these functions for file/input/output operations does not require modification when the underlying operating system changes.</p>
    <p>
        ExpL allows programs to create files of type string only.
    </p>
    <pre>        Int Fcreate (filename)
    </pre>
    <p>Creates a file. Filename must be a constant string or a string variable. If the operaton failed, return value is 0, otherwise 1 is returned on success.
</p>
    <p>
    To delete an already existing file, the library function
    </p><pre>        Int Fdelete(filename)
    </pre>
        must be invoked. The function returns 1 if the file was successfully deleted, and 0 otherwise.
    <p></p>
    <p>
    Files are accessed using file descriptors. The keyword file is used to declare file descriptors. File descriptors must be declared in the declaration section. (Add a note in the declaration part of ExpL spec. that in addition to variable declarations, file descriptors are also declared in the declaration section, and that a discussion of them is taken up later).
    Example :
    </p><pre>        file fd; /* fd is can hold the descriptor for a file */
    </pre>
    stdin and stdout are two special descriptors indicating the standard input and standard output.
    These descriptors does not need any declaration. Their use will explained later.
    Before accessing a file, the file must be opened by:
    <pre>        fd = Fopen(filename);   /*  File name can either be a string constant or a string variable*/
    </pre>
    If the operation fails the pre-defined constant NULL will be assigned to fd. This allows programmers to check whether the operation was successful. The operation fails also when the file does not exist.   A file descriptor can be used to open only one file in a program.  However, a file could be opened several times using different descriptors.
<p></p>
    <p>
    A file that is opened may be closed by
    </p><pre>        Int Fclose(fd);
    </pre>
    Close fails and returns 0 if the file descriptor does not correspond to any open file. Otherwise, 1 is returned indicating success.
    <p></p>
    <p>
        The library functions for read and write into files are used to access and modify files. ExpL treats each file as a sequential stream of strings and every read or write operation advances the access position for read/write operation using the corresponding descriptor.
    </p>

    <pre>        Int Fread(fd, var)
    </pre>
    <p> This function reads the next number/string from the file and stores the value into a variable. The argument variable (var) must either be of type integer of string. If the variable is of type integer, the read string will be interpreted as an integer and stored in the varable. Details of this conversion is platform dependent and are left unspecified.
</p>
    <p>Read fails and returns 0 if the read operation tries to read beyond the limits of the file. Otherwise, the return value is 1 indicating success. Note that a compilation error must result if the descriptor does not correspond to an open file instance (the structure of ExpL makes this possible during compilation) or if the type of var is not integer or string.</p>
    <p>Fread(stdin, var) reads from the standard input into the variable. The input read is interpreted by ExpL to be of type intger or string depending on the type of the var. The return value is 0 if the read operation fails, 1 otherwise.</p>
    <pre>        Int Fwrite(fd, expr)
    </pre>
    <p>Writes the contents of var into the current access location in the file. Write fails if the file cannot be written further (possibily because of non availability of storage space) and returns 0. Otherwise, 1 is returned upon success. Note that the type of fd and expr must be a string or integer. Semantic convension of treating integers and strings in files holds in this case as well.</p>
    <p>If the file descriptor is stdout, the value of expr is printed on to the output.</p>
    <p>Finally, the seek function allows the file access location to be shifted by an offset specified.</p>
    <pre>        Int Fseek(fd, offset)
    </pre>
    <p>Offset must be an integer expression. The file access position gets adjusted by the offset value. An offset value of zero resets the file access position to the beginning of the file. Seek operation is of no consequence when the descriptor is stdin or stdout.</p>
    <p>Note: As noted earlier, implementation of the file and standard input/output operations in ExpL is done by tranlating the file operations to the system calls/interface routines provided by the underlying operating sytem. The following LINK describes the application binary interface (ABI) of the eXpOS operating system.</p>

      <h3>Identifiers</h3>
      <p>Identifiers are names of variables and user-defined functions. Identifiers should start with an letter, and may contain both letters and digits. Special characters are not allowed in identifiers.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;">letter -&gt; [a-z]|[A-Z]</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;">digit -&gt; [0-9]</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;">identifier -&gt; (letter)(letter | digit)*</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Constants</h3>
      <p>Interger constants are represented in the standard way. Any sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes (”) are considered as string constant.  Normally,  implementations append a  ’\0’ character which is implicitly appended at the end of a string value.  The maximum size of integers and strings are left to the implementation. ExpL uses the generic constant NULL to indicate the values of unallocated user defined variables and unassigned file descriptors.</p>
